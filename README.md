# Predicting-House-Sale-Price
The price of a house canâ€™t be predicted by studying the number of bedrooms and bathrooms, the height of the ceiling, the age of the property or even the extensive study of the neighborhood. A house that becomes a home of a family needs to tick off all the boxes. A house buyer considers a lot more than the statistics of the property before investing his/her hard earned money into it. This project attempts to expand the house prediction model to predict the sale price of a house in Ames, Iowa by taking into account various parameters a house buyer is most likely to consider. We are using the Ames housing dataset that consists of 79 explanatory variables i.e, 37 quantitative and 42 qualitative that describe almost every possible aspect of residential homes.
